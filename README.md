# NetCortex

An Agentic AI Platform for Autonomous Network Operations

5G control-plane capture analysis: decode NGAP/NAS (N2), PFCP (N4), and SBI
(HTTP/2) captures, map per-UE flows, compute KPIs, triage failed
procedures with an LLM agent, and run incidents through a human-gated
remediation pipeline.

## The dispatch pipeline

![Dispatch pipeline — raise or detect, handle, human-gated execution, close + learn](dispatch/docs/diagrams/pipeline.png)

One incident, end to end: an Alarm event (human-raised or synthesized
from KPI degradation) fans out to three specialist evidence agents,
their findings are correlated, a LATS root-cause search runs, and a
remediation proposal from a fixed five-action vocabulary waits at the
Human approval gate — with the Outcome feeding a gated learning loop.
The committed end-to-end
[`sample Incident Record`](dispatch/docs/sample-incident-record.md) shows
a real `n4_upf_timeout` run: detected from KPI degradation, investigated
by the live specialists, left **pending** at the gate. The same run is
rendered as an interactive incident page — [`The Blackholed UPF`](https://adriandonohoe.github.io/NetCortex/demo/),
hosted on GitHub Pages from [`demo/index.html`](demo/index.html). The
diagram's source of truth is
[`dispatch/docs/diagrams/pipeline.json`](dispatch/docs/diagrams/pipeline.json).

## The impact advisory

![impact — pre-change advisory, end to end](impact/docs/diagrams/impact-flow.png)

Before a Change lands: a proposed NF upgrade or config change is
assessed read-only against the platform's evidence — the episode
stores, the Change History, prior captures' dependency structure, the
3GPP specgraph, and an optional human test plan — and graded HIGH,
MEDIUM, LOW, or INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE by a fixed rubric whose every
factor is cited in the report. The Impact Report ends with pre-checks
and rollback criteria; a human decides and applies, then records the
Outcome — applied, rejected, or rolled-back — through the annotation
loop, which alone writes the Change History. A new Change matching a
past failed record grades HIGH. See
[`impact/README.md`](impact/README.md); the diagram's source of truth
is [`impact/docs/diagrams/impact-flow.json`](impact/docs/diagrams/impact-flow.json).

## Layout

- [`5gcap/`](5gcap/) — the analyzer itself (`5gcap analyze <file.pcap>`),
  one binary ladder N2 → N4 → SBI; given all three captures, one merged
  JSON export correlated by strict key equality (ADR-0007). See
  [`5gcap/README.md`](5gcap/README.md) for usage and v1 scope.
- [`triage/`](triage/) — LLM-agent root-cause hypothesis generation over
  5gcap's decode output (LATS search, episodic memory, 3GPP spec graph; on
  the merged export, joined SBI/N4 Incidents carry their flow id), a
  deterministic post-incident report writer, and an offline eval harness
  scored against labeled sandbox fixtures. A sample post-incident report
  from a live run is in
  [`triage/examples/`](triage/examples/auth_failure-report.md). See
  [`triage/README.md`](triage/README.md).
- [`sandbox/`](sandbox/) — local Open5GS + UERANSIM lab that generates real
  captures for `5gcap` and labeled failure-injection scenario fixtures
  (`./capture.sh --scenario <name>`) for triage's evals. See
  [`sandbox/README.md`](sandbox/README.md).
- [`dispatch/`](dispatch/) — event-driven incident orchestration over the
  stack: a KPI-degradation detector or a human raises an Alarm event,
  PCAP/Log/KPI specialist agents ground evidence against the decode,
  core logs and the Golden baseline, a root-cause search correlates it,
  and a remediation proposal from a fixed five-action vocabulary waits
  at a Human approval gate. A real end-to-end
  [`sample Incident Record`](dispatch/docs/sample-incident-record.md) is
  committed. See [`dispatch/README.md`](dispatch/README.md).
- [`impact/`](impact/) — pre-change advisory over the stack: a proposed
  Change (NF upgrade or config change) is assessed read-only against the
  platform's evidence — episode stores, the Change History, captures,
  the specgraph, an optional human test plan — and graded by a fixed
  cited rubric into an Impact Report with pre-checks and rollback
  criteria. A human decides and applies, then records the Outcome
  through the annotation loop that alone writes the Change History.
  See [`impact/README.md`](impact/README.md).
- [`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md) — 5gcap domain glossary (Capture, Flow,
  Procedure, KPI, Partial Flow); [`triage/CONTEXT.md`](triage/CONTEXT.md) —
  triage domain glossary; [`dispatch/CONTEXT.md`](dispatch/CONTEXT.md) —
  dispatch domain glossary; [`impact/CONTEXT.md`](impact/CONTEXT.md) —
  impact domain glossary. [`CONTEXT-MAP.md`](CONTEXT-MAP.md) maps the
  four contexts and their relationships.
- [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/) — architecture decision records.
- Diagrams — [`docs/diagrams/`](docs/diagrams/) holds the 5gcap pipeline
  diagram from the Medium article (fireworks-tech-graph IR + rendered
  SVG + PNG, style 2 Dark Terminal; the regeneration recipe, including
  the no-system-fonts PNG trap, is in its
  [`README`](docs/diagrams/README.md));
  [`dispatch/docs/diagrams/`](dispatch/docs/diagrams/) holds the
  dispatch pipeline's set — the same IR + SVG + PNG trio plus
  LangGraph's own mermaid view of the compiled graph for comparison —
  with the same recipe in its
  [`README`](dispatch/docs/diagrams/README.md); and
  [`triage/docs/diagrams/`](triage/docs/diagrams/) holds the triage
  invocation-flow diagram (IR + SVG);
  [`impact/docs/diagrams/`](impact/docs/diagrams/) holds the impact
  advisory-flow diagram (IR + SVG + PNG) with the same recipe in its
  [`README`](impact/docs/diagrams/README.md).

## Roadmap

Planned as sibling projects on this platform: a **Cross-Domain Incident
Correlation** project and a **Digital Twin** — each will land as its
own top-level directory alongside `5gcap/`, `triage/`, `dispatch/`,
and `impact/`.
